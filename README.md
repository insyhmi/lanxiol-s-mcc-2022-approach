# lanxiol-s-mcc-2022-approach
My approach to the Malaysian Computing Challenge 2022

This repo is intended to showcase my approach to the problem statements in MCC 2022.
It is not the official solution for the competition.

The approaches are made in Python 3.12 and used the sample inputs provided in the statement documents.
There might be errors in my solution, so feel free to improve it.
